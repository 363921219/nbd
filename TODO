* Can we do language bindings using #!'s?
  You would enter:
    nbdkit foo [args]
  where nbdkit-foo-plugin is a Perl script starting:
    #!perl
  which causes nbdkit to load the perl plugin wrapper.

* syslog? journal?

* Glance and/or cinder plugins.

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Implement export names.  With export names it should be possible to
  have multiple plugins on the command line (each responding to a
  different export of course):

    nbdkit --export /foo plugin.so --export /bar another-plugin.so

  Note it should also be possible to either elect one plugin as the
  default that accepts all exportnames, or to divide the export name
  "space" up using regexps or wildcards.

  Export names are not actually paths (although that is how they are
  often used), but arbitrary UTF-8 text strings.

* Implement true parallel request handling.  Currently
  NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_REQUESTS and
  NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_PARALLEL are the same, because we handle
  requests within each connection synchronously one at a time.  We
  could (and should) be able to handle them in parallel by having
  another thread pool for requests.
