Implement the new protocol and export names.  With export names it
should be possible to have multiple plugins on the command line (each
responding to a different export of course):

  nbdkit --export /foo plugin.so --export /bar another-plugin.so

Note it should also be possible to either elect one plugin as the
default that accepts all exportnames, or to divide the export name
"space" up using regexps or wildcards.
