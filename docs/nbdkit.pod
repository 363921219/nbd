=head1 NAME

nbdkit - A toolkit for creating NBD servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit [-f] [-g GROUP] [-i IPADDR] [-P PIDFILE] [-p PORT]
        [-r] [-s] [-U SOCKET] [-u USER] [-v] [-V]
        PLUGIN.so [key=value [key=value [...]]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit> is both a toolkit for creating Network Block Device (NBD)
servers from "unconventional" sources and the name of an NBD server.

To create a new block device source, all you have to do is write a few
glue functions.  The liberal licensing of nbdkit is meant to allow you
to link nbdkit with proprietary libraries or include nbdkit in
proprietary code.

If you want to write an nbdkit plugin, you should read
L<nbdkit-plugin(3)>.

Several plugins may be found in C<LIBDIR/nbdkit/plugins> where
C<LIBDIR> is set at compile time and might be a path such as
C</usr/lib>, C</usr/lib64> or C</usr/local/lib>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Serve file C<disk.img> on port 10809:

 nbdkit .../plugins/libnbdkit-file.so file=disk.img

Run the example1 plugin and connect to it using L<guestfish(1)>:

 nbdkit .../plugins/libnbdkit-example1.so
 guestfish --ro -a nbd://localhost

To display usage information about a specific plugin:

 nbdkit --help .../plugins/libnbdkit-example1.so

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Display brief command line usage information and exit.

=item B<-f>

=item B<--foreground>

=item B<--no-fork>

I<Don't> fork into the background.

=item B<-g> GROUP

=item B<--group> GROUP

Change group to C<GROUP> after starting up.  A group name or numeric
group ID can be used.

The server needs sufficient permissions to be able to do this.
Normally this would mean starting the server up as root.

See also I<-u>.

=item B<-i> IPADDR

=item B<--ip-addr> IPADDR

=item B<--ipaddr> IPADDR

Listen on the specified interface.  The default is to listen on all
interfaces.  See also I<-p>.

=item B<-P> PIDFILE

=item B<--pid-file> PIDFILE

=item B<--pidfile> PIDFILE

Write C<PIDFILE> (containing the process ID of the server) after
nbdkit becomes ready to accept connections.

If the file already exists, it is overwritten.  nbdkit I<does not>
delete the file when it exits.

=item B<-p> PORT

=item B<--port> PORT

Change the TCP/IP port number on which nbdkit serves requests.
The default is C<10809>.  See also I<-i>.

=item B<-r>

=item B<--read-only>

=item B<--readonly>

The export will be read-only.  If a client writes, then it will get an
error.

Note that some plugins inherently don't support writes.  With those
plugins the I<-r> option is added implicitly.

Copy-on-write (or "snapshot") functionality is not supported by this
server.  However if you are using qemu as a client (or indirectly via
libguestfs) then it supports snapshots.

=item B<-s>

=item B<--single>

=item B<--stdin>

Don't fork.  Handle a single NBD connection on stdin/stdout.  After
stdin closes, the server exits.

You can use this option to run nbdkit from inetd, systemd or similar
superservers; or just for testing; or if you want to run nbdkit in a
non-conventional way.

This option implies I<--foreground>.

=item B<-U> SOCKET

=item B<--unix> SOCKET

Accept connections on the Unix domain socket C<SOCKET> (which is a
path).

nbdkit neither creates nor deletes this socket.  You should create the
socket and set the desired permissions and ownership before running
the server.

=item B<-u> USER

=item B<--user> USER

Change user to C<USER> after starting up.  A user name or numeric user
ID can be used.

The server needs sufficient permissions to be able to do this.
Normally this would mean starting the server up as root.

See also I<-g>.

=item B<-v>

=item B<--verbose>

Enable verbose messages.

It's a good idea to use I<-f> as well so the process does not fork
into the background (but not required).

=item B<-V>

=item B<--version>

Print the version number of nbdkit and exit.

=back

=head1 PLUGIN CONFIGURATION

After specifying the plugin name you can (optionally, it depends
on the plugin) give plugin configuration on the command line in
the form of C<key=value>.  For example:

 nbdkit .../plugins/libnbdkit-file.so file=disk.img

To list all the options supported by a plugin, do:

 nbdkit --help .../plugins/libnbdkit-file.so
