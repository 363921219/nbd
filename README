NBD is a protocol for accessing block devices (hard disks and
disk-like things) over the network.

'nbdkit' is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

* Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

* Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
  Let's you export "unconventional" block devices easily.

* Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
  libraries or included in proprietary code.
