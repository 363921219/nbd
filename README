NBD is a simple protocol for accessing block devices over the network.
'nbdkit' is a toolkit for creating NBD servers from "unconventional"
sources.  All you have to do is write a few glue functions.  The
liberal licensing of nbdkit is meant to allow you to link nbdkit with
proprietary libraries or include nbdkit in proprietary code.
